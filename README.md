# US Population Segmentation

Unsupervised learning techniques with PCA &amp; Kmeans to assign each county to a particular cluster.

# Description 
This is data collected from the US census. Using Data cleaning we can reduce the excess amounts of data. In this notebook, you'll employ two, unsupervised learning algorithms to do population segmentation. Population segmentation aims to find natural groupings in population data that reveal some feature-level similarities between different regions in the US.
